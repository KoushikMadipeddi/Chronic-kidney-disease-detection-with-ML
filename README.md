# Chronic-kidney-disease-detection-with-ML

The project aims to classify chronic kidney disease (CKD) using a Random Forest Classifier, a robust machine learning model. The Random Forest Classifier operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (majority vote) as the prediction. This ensemble method combines the strengths of both filter and wrapper methods for feature selection, enhancing the model's accuracy.

Data Input: The CKD dataset is preprocessed and fed into the model.

Data Preprocessing:
  Handling Missing Values: Replace or remove missing values to ensure the dataset is complete.,
  Normalization: Scale numerical features to ensure uniformity.,
  Categorical Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical values using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
 
Feature Selection:
Random Forest inherently performs feature selection by measuring the importance of each feature. The importance score is based on how much each feature reduces the impurity (Gini impurity or entropy) in the forest's decision trees.

Model Training:
Building Decision Trees: The Random Forest algorithm builds multiple decision trees using different subsets of the data.,
Bootstrap Aggregation: Each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample (random sample with replacement) of the data.,
Combining Results: The final classification for a patient is determined by aggregating the predictions of all individual trees through majority voting.

Applications:
The model can be used by healthcare professionals to:
Early Detection: Identify patients at risk of CKD for early intervention., 
Decision Support: Assist in clinical decision-making by providing a second opinion based on data-driven insights., 
Resource Allocation: Optimize the allocation of medical resources by identifying high-risk patients who may need more intensive care.

This project showcases the application of machine learning in the medical field, demonstrating how advanced algorithms can aid in the diagnosis and management of chronic diseases like CKD.
